rbgames.pkl is too large to upload to github. This file contains the single game statistics of every running back for every game since the 1950 season. If you would like to create it, download the json datasets here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats
and then run the program ../../src/make_pkl/rbgames.py
